# 👋 Hi, I'm Danijel

I'm a 20-year-old tech enthusiast from Germany who loves working on Arduino projects and robotics. My biggest passion is building and programming intelligent robots that can interact with the world around them.

I'm currently:
- 🤖 Creating custom robots with Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi
- 💡 Exploring sensors, motor control, and wireless communication (ESP-NOW)
- 👨‍💻 Learning software development with a focus on Python and C
- 🧠 Working towards becoming a software developer who bridges hardware and software

My dream is to combine robotics and AI to build helpful, smart systems that make life easier.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub — feel free to explore my projects!
